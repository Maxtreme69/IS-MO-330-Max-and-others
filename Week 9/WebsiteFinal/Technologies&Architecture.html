                      HTML, Hypertext Mark-up Language is the standard mark-up language that is used for creating web pages, it describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements. HTML is not a programming language, therefore it is not capable of creating dynamic functionality. HTML allowed us to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links and blockquotes as well as organise and format documents and multimedia. We have used this mark-up language for the text that is present in our website. Therefore, making the text readable, as well as controlling the structure of our page. We have formatted the text and other features controlled by HTML using html tags.

                      CSS is the language that is used for modifying the presentation of web pages. It allows for the programmer to adapt the colour, layout and fonts of the website. CSS has been used in our web application to create an application that follows a conventional format as well as having a consistent layout throughout the web application. With the use off CSS, we have been able to create header features, such as the header which is a major part of the design of the website, as it is carried over all of the web pages. It has also allowed for us to make our website more attractive by changing elements such as font colour, background colour and many other elements that contribute to the websites design and aesthetics.

                      JavaScript is a text-based programming language that is object-oriented and is used for creating more attractive websites, as well as making web development easier. HTML alone cannot create the interactive features that increase the useability of a website. Therefore, we have coupled JavaScript with HTML to create a web application that produces a result when the user interacts with the website or completes an action. Many features in our scrum board web application such as the carousel feature for the calendar will scroll through the dates using arrow buttons that are programmed using JavaScript.

                      PHP, Hypertext Pre-processor is an open source, server-side language that is embedded in HTML and is used to create dynamic web pages. It is a widely used scripting language that is free to download and to be used. PHP can perform tasks that any CGI program can perform, it is also compatible with many types of databases. PHP is mostly used to make static websites into dynamic websites. It can generate dynamic page content as well as create files on the server. One of the implementations of PHP for our teams Scrum Master web application includes connecting our webpage to the server and retrieving and storing input from users to the database.

                      PhpMyAdmin is a software tool written in PHP which is also free to use that handles the administration of MySQL database server. It is suited to perform many of the administration tasks including creating a database, running queries, and adding user accounts. This program allows us to create a server that is secure, only allowing users with access to the server to be able to access the data that is stored on the server. This is important as groups projects, usernames and passwords will be stored on the Scrum Master web application database. This is not the only information that will be stored. Furthermore, other information stored can be sensitive also.

                      MySQL is a widely used database management system, it can manage sets of data such as a list to very complex data with huge amounts of information. MySQL is mostly used in corporate situations and therefore we deemed it suitable for our project, as our scrum board is mainly focused on making it easier for teams from software development companies to manage their projects. In our scenario it will be managing data ranging from a moderate to vast amount depending on the specific user. However, MySQL's ability to manage both situations allows for it to be a program that can be relied on for our project.

                     Figma is an application for interface design that runs solely on the browser, but it is much more than that. I would go so far to say that it is a perfect application for collaborative design projects focused on team projects. Figma provides all the tools you need for the designing aspect of the project such as vector aid which allows fully- fledged illustration, as well as prototyping capabilities and more. In addition, Figma allows live collaboration for a team to work together at the same time as well as saving progress online, so teams won't have to worry about losing the save files. In our case, Figma will be our primary design tool for our project's wireframes for both MVF and EVF.

                     Microsoft Teams is a collaborative platform that has a wide range of uses such as document sharing, online meetings, plan meetings, chat with individuals or teams and a lot more useful features. It is normally used in education and business industries due to its excellent team space which may allow people to make creative decisions and communicate with each other. Microsoft teams is also available on both Android and IOS which makes Microsoft Teams easily accessible from anywhere nowadays with the help of the internet. For our case, Microsoft Teams is where all our meetings were held and recorded the link to those meetings is included in our html 'information' page.

Amazon web services provided a platform to host our website and bucket to add all our relevant files to, including our html Assignement website files. AWS allows multiple users access to the same bucket which also helped in our teamwork and made sure all of us were able to access the relevant files needed.
